# TG2-api
This repo was created to deploy the backend of the TG2.0 project to Render so we could test the TG2.0 with users.
This project is based on the NeuroRehabLab TaskGenerator and was proposed as a thesis project to extend the already established platform to an interactive platform where the paper-and-pencil tasks can be executed virtually.

### Dependencies
Before trying to run the application make sure to install the dependencies of the project

```sh
# Backend
$ cd backend
$ npm i
```
